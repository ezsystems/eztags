You can see eZ Tags in action by following the steps below:

1. Import sample tags to the database (sql/mysql/samples.sql) or create your own tags.

2. Edit the Article class and add a new Tags attribute.

3. Edit one of your Article objects and add some of the existing tags to the object.

4. Publish the object and view it on the frontend. You should see the list of tags
   attached to the object just below the body of the article.

5. (OPTIONAL) To be able to see related tags feature in action, first configure eZ Find
   as per instructions in "doc/INSTALL" file. Then create/edit couple of more Article
   objects, add tags to them and make sure that all objects share at least one tag.
   Related tags should be displayed by opening http://yoursite.com/tags/view/tag_name
