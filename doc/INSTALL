Installation
============

IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a bug in eZ Image Editor 1.1 extension (ezie, released with eZ Publish 4.4)
that prevents eZ Tags datatype from functioning if your site is using jQuery version 1.4.3 and above.
This bug is fixed in extension version 1.2 (released with eZ Publish 4.5). To fix this, upgrade the
extension to 1.2, or downgrade your jQuery to 1.4.2
Bugfix commit is located at: https://github.com/ezsystems/ezie/commit/6f29d071b8b100d62651ce8b696b97bf0f8f8b98

0. Enable admin2 design in your eZ Publish Legacy installation

   Since eZ Publish 5.0 and merging and renaming of `admin2` design into `admin`, `admin2` is no longer turned on in clean installs of
   eZ Publish. For backwards compatibility with eZ Publish 4.x, `admin2` design in eZ Tags cannot be renamed to `admin`.
   To use eZ Tags in eZ Publish 5.x, please make sure to set the `admin2` design as the main design for your administration
   siteaccess by setting the following configuration in `site.ini.append.php`

   [DesignSettings]
   SiteDesign=admin2
   AdditionalSiteDesignList[]=admin

1. Unpack/unzip

   Unpack the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your eZ Publish installation.

2. Create SQL tables in your eZ Publish database

   Extension requires two additional tables to be added to your database. Use the following command from your eZ Publish
   root folder, replacing "user", "password", "host" and "database" with correct values and removing double quotes

   mysql -u "user" -p"password" -h"host" "database" < extension/eztags/sql/mysql/schema.sql

3. Activate extension

   Activate the extension by using the admin interface ( Setup -> Extensions ) or by
   prepending eztags to ActiveExtensions[] in settings/override/site.ini.append.php:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveExtensions[]=eztags

   Be sure to place the eztags entry before ezwebin entry in active extension list if you wish to have a working example that is provided

4. Regenerate autoload array

   Run the following from your eZ Publish root folder

   php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php --extension

   Or go to Setup -> Extensions and click the "Regenerate autoload arrays" button

5. Clear caches

   Clear all caches (from admin 'Setup' tab or from command line).

6. Speedup ajax calls

   1. Copy or symlink index_treemenu_tags.php from this extension to the root folder of eZ Publish (next to index.php)

   2. Add the following rewrite rule:

      * .htaccess
        RewriteRule tags/treemenu/? index_treemenu_tags.php
        RewriteRule ^index_treemenu_tags\.php - [L]

      * Virtual Host mode
        RewriteRule tags/treemenu/ /index_treemenu_tags.php [L]

7. Allow anonymous users access to tags

   For anonymous users to be able to see tags on your site, grant access to "view" function of "tags" module to Anonymous role

8. (OPTIONAL) - If you wish to use tags suggestions and see related tags, you must use ezfind extension.
   Edit the file extension/ezfind/java/solr/conf/schema.xml to add the following lines and then restart Tomcat/Jetty:

   * Inside <schema> element add:
     <copyField source="*_lk" dest="ezf_df_tags"/>
     <copyField source="*_k" dest="ezf_df_tags"/>

   * Inside <fields> element add:
     <field name="ezf_df_tags" type="text" indexed="true" stored="true" multiValued="true" termVectors="true"/>
