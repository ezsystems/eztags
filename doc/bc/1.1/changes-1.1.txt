Changes to BC and behavior in version 1.1
=========================================

Renamed fetches
---------------

- tags/object fetch has been renamed to tags/tag. tags/object_by_keyword fetch has been renamed to tags/tags_by_keyword

  Adding new fetches required old ones to be updated to better suit the naming scheme. This has great impact on all templates (built in and custom)
  that use these fetches. They need to be modified to use updated fetch names.

Change of behavior
------------------

- tags/object_by_keyword fetch, along with the rename has been modified to return all tags it fetches and not just the first one

  It makes more sense to filter out what you need directly in the templates, then to limit the fetch functionality

Changes to method signatures
----------------------------

- eZTagsFunctionCollection - fetchTagObject renamed to fetchTag to match the corresponding fetch

- eZTagsFunctionCollection - fetchTagObjectByKeyword renamed to fetchTagsByKeyword to match the corresponding fetch

- eZTagsObject - fetchList - added parameter $sorts to the end of the parameter list, non required, defaults to null
