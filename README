eZ Tags is an extension for eZ Publish, providing more functionality for tagging
content objects than ezkeyword datatype included in eZ Publish kernel.

Main advantages of eZ Tags extension over ezkeyword datatype are:
    - tree hierarchy of tags
    - easily managable through eZ Publish admin interface with adding, deleting
      and editing tags and their children
    - easy tagging in object edit interface with tags autocompletion, suggestion
      and in place addition of new tags
    - tags view interface, similar to content view, providing access to $tag
      variable (current tag viewed, that is)
